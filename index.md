Data have been obtained from the following sources:\
[South Florida Reef Visual Census](http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/rvc_analysis20/samples/index)

[Water Quality Data](http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/FKNMS-CD/data_user_agreement.htm) were provided by the SERC-FIU Water Quality Monitoring Network which is supported by EPA Agreement #X7 00D02412-1 and NOAA Agreement #NA09NOS4260253.\

[CREMP generic and non-generic data](https://ocean.floridamarine.org/fknms_wqpp/coral.htm) provided by Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP), supported by NOAA, EPA and Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection.\

[National Coral Reef Monitoring Program](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:NCRMP-Benthic-Florida) data were used particularly related to invertebrate observations. 


### Project Explanation and Goals

The biodiversity and abundance of the Florida Keys has made them a destination for people all over the world. Several factors have put pressure on this unique ecosystem. The goal of this project is to model water quality and biodiversity/species richness in the past, present and future. It is the hope that this information may give insight into management strategies in the future. 

### Data Aggregation and Storage
Data have been aggregated from multiple sources and stored on a local MongoDB. Some data have been modified or merged. There are several databases seperated by subject matter or source. While this data is not currently publically accessible, it is the hope that these data can be provided in their tidy form here in the near future. Raw data is available at the sources listed, or upon request.
